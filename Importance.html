        <center><u><i>"Better Environment, Better Tomorrow "</Font></center></i></u>
        <center><font size = 3 face = Arial color= black ><p>
            For millions of years, nature provides us everything to live a better life and start from clothes, food, light, air, and furniture to beautiful landscapes, waterfalls, and forests. The ecosystem helps us with agriculture and grow crops and vegetables. Our waste products were absorbed and decomposed as compost for agriculture. Humans were served by the environment in several ways and are still using nature for various personal uses.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Today the pressure of high population and so many people are taking a toll on nature and creating a lot of stress. The entire system of living beings around the Globe is collapsing. Our planet’s biosystem, which consists of both the chemical and physical environment, is constantly changing, causing our world to deplete gradually. Earlier, humans could not cause much damage the environment, and if they did, it was on a small area of land. However, today the human population is constantly increasing with various technological advancements, automobiles, and more. Today, the environment is about farm fields and agriculture, but it consists of the entire planet. They are thus resulting in a complete disruption and misbalance in our ecosystem. Without realizing the long term consequences, modern people are still continuously using different means of hazardous elements that adversely affect our nature.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Over the years, people were concerned about their health, living conditions, various diseases, pandemics, famines, accidents, and vector borne diseases. The farming and domesticating animals formed new contagious disorders among people, creating new challenges for better health among people.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                With the advancement of technologies and the development of industries, various water-borne and other diseases were prevented. However, it adversely affects the environment by using harmful gases, chemicals, and building wastes. The trade and commerce, industries, and other factories paved the way for humans to leave the agricultural field and step into the technological world. The air, water, and soil pollution is affecting the environment, and it is damaging rapidly. Harmful greenhouse gases are causing the greenhouse effect. The protective ozone layer is depleting, causing the sun’s direct ultra-violet rays to enter the Earth and cause the snow to melt and produce serious skin diseases infections among animals and humans.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Ecology is the study of plants and animals and how they work together to balance nature. Humans must be responsible and use nature efficiently and only to survive for causing less damage. Various animals are going into extinction because of lack of trees, increased pollution, use of electronic gadgets and waves. The birds that once migrated to the urban areas from the rural districts were now seen nowhere because of the harmful emissions from the industries and the electronic waves through mobile phones and internet connections. This imbalance of nature is causing serious complications and danger for a long-lasting life on Earth.<br><br></p>

<center><u><i>"Most of the damage to our environment stems from consumption: <br>
    what we consume, how much we consume and how often. "</Font></center></i></u><br><br>
    <Font size= 5 face= Georgia color= Black><center>
        So here are a few ways you can start to protect the environment today:<br><br></font></center>
        <center><Font size= 5 face= Georgia color= Black>
        1. Consume less.
        </Font><br><br></center>
        <font size = 3 face = Arial color= black >
           
Curbing consumption can have a huge impact on the environment. The three "R's"—reduce, reuse and recycle— get a lot of attention, but the planet could benefit from some focus on the most important and most underrepresented "R": refuse.

When you refuse, you say "no," which is not always easy. Freebies at events, cheap goods on clearance, the hot new children's toys or the latest gadgets that promise to make your life better—none of these are essential.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</font>
<Font size= 5 face= Georgia color= Black><center>
    2. Compost.<br><br>
</Font></center>
<font size = 3 face = Arial color= black >
    Another “R” that doesn’t get much attention but has important environmental implications is “rot.” As in, let your food and yard waste rot naturally in the soil instead of sending it to the landfill. In other words: compost.

Composting your food scraps and yard waste offers double rewards: it keeps an incredible amount of trash out of the waste stream, and it produces free, rich soil to use in your garden. <br><br><br>

<Font size= 5 face= Georgia color= Black><center>
    3. Choose reusable over single-use.<br><br></center>
</Font>
<font size = 3 face = Arial color= black >
    Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages from disposable cups or disposable bottles, sipping from disposable straws, carrying disposable grocery bags, eating from disposable plates or containers and using disposable utensils. All that single-use plastic has to go somewhere, and it’s had a devastating effect on our soil, oceans and marine life.

All of the above items (and more) have more environmentally responsible counterparts. Switch to reusable items and make a commitment to use them as often as possible. You’ll have less trash piling up at your curb, and you’ll be helping to protect the environment in a major way.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
</font>
<Font size= 5 face= Georgia color= Black><center>
    4. Upcycle more.<br><br>
</Font></center>
<font size = 3 face = Arial color= black >
    Get creative with your useless or unwanted items by upcycling—basically, turning trash into treasure. Creating something new such as artwork, toys or jewelry is both satisfying and one of the best ways to protect the environment. Not only does it keep items out of the trash, it can prevent having to purchase new items, which require lots of resources to produce. Children love making things; so instead of heading to the craft store, check out your recycle bin first and let their imaginations soar!<br><br><br>
    </font><br><br>
    <center><img src="Images/reusable.jpg" alt="Save" width ="250" height="200" ALIGN ="center" HSPACE="20" VSPACE="20">
    <img src="Images/upcycle.jpg" alt="Save" width ="250" height="200" ALIGN ="center" HSPACE="20" VSPACE="20" ></center><br><br><br>
    <Font size= 5 face= Georgia color= Black><center>
        5. Recycle properly.<br><br></center>
    </Font>
    <font size = 3 face = Arial color= black >
        f you can’t refuse it…and you can’t rot it…and you can’t reduce it…and you can’t upcycle or reuse it…then it’s time to turn to the final “R”—recycling. Educate yourself on what can and cannot be recycled in your bins at home. Throwing the wrong items in the recycle bin can result in an entire load being rejected, which means … back to the landfill.

You can also easily find out how to recycle special items such as electronics, batteries and appliances. Check with your local municipality for drop-off sites, and make an effort to get your items to the proper disposal sites.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    6. Shop secondhand.</center>
    </font/>
    <font size = 3 face = Arial color= black >
        Did you know it takes over 700 gallons of water to grow enough cotton to make just one plain t-shirt?

Instead of heading to the mall to buy new clothes, consider looking first in a thrift store or vintage shop, or trading clothes with friends. You can breathe new life into your wardrobe without wasting the precious resources needed to produce new clothing.

Shopping secondhand also applies for many other categories of consumer goods: children’s games and toys, shoes, appliances, furniture, cars and more.<br><br><br>
