    Environment means anything that surround us.
    It can be living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) things. It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces.Living things live in their environment.They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment.
    In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, 
    water, and other living and non-living things.

    Natural Environment

Everything that is not human-made comes under natural environment. Land, air, water, plants and animals all comprise the natural environment.Natural environments affect human health and well-being both directly and indirectly. Urban green and blue areas provide opportunities for stress recovery and physical activity. They offer spaces for social interactions in the neighborhood and places for childrenâ€™s play. Chronic stress, physical inactivity, and lack of social cohesion are three major risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, and therefore abundant urban greenery is an important asset for health promotion.<br><br>
Through numerous ecosystem services natural environments play a fundamental role in protecting health. Various populations depend on nature for basic material, such as fresh water, wood, fuel, and nutritious food. Biodiverse natural areas are also necessary for regulating the environment and for mitigating and adapting to climate change. For example, tree canopy cover can reduce the urban heat island effect substantially, preventing excess morbidity during heat waves. This natural heat-reducing effect also lessens the need for air conditioning systems and as a consequence decreases energy spending. <br>

Ecosystem
</font> <br><p></u>
 All plants, animals and human beings depend on each other. The relation between living organisms, as well as the relation between living organisms and their environment, form an ecosystem. An ocean is an example of an ecosystem because it comprises of living organisms, land, air ( in dissolved form) and water of course.

 Human Environment

Human environment is the man-made environment. It has been modified by humans according to their needs. Before technology evolved, human beings would adapt themselves to the natural environment. They led a simple life and fulfilled their requirements from the nature around them. With time, their needs grew and became more varied. Human learnt new ways to change their environment according to their needs.<br><br>
As the global human population continues to grow, so too does our impact on the environment. The ingenuity with which our species has harnessed natural resources to fulfill our needs is dazzling. Even as we tighten our grip on the environment, however, the escalating extent of anthropogenic actions destabilizes long-standing ecological balances. The dangers of mining, refining, and fossil fuel consumption now extend beyond occupational or proximate risks to global climate change.<br><br>
Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. These negative impacts can affect human behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water.

    Save Environment

   The environment is the most important aspect to survive on this planet. Humans tend to forget that without a balanced environment, life cannot be sustained. With climate change upon us, sea levels on the rise, and increasing numbers of earthquakes, floods, and droughts, we cannot stress this enough.

The increase in contamination and pollution of precious resources, and even more importantly, the exploitation of forest areas as they are roped in for various business ventures need to stop immediately if we are to hope for human survival.<br><br>

Hence, to spread awareness and make people understand that a small positive step taken by each person can make big changes, 'World Environment Day' is celebrated every year.

The day is celebrated to highlight the importance of the environment and how to prevent environmental degradation and use natural resources within the natural discipline.<br>
